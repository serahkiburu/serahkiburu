Hi there! My name is Serah Njambi Rono, my pronouns are she/her/hers, and I am a computer scientist and a writer.

I am currently finding ways to improve developer experiences at Spotify, and have served as a technologist and Developer Advocate in the Open Data, Open Source, Open Science space for more than 8 years now. My experience and interests revolve around (i)all things open source, (ii)listening to, working with and empowering communities, (iii)developing and implementing strategies both for various technical projects, and around community building, outreach and the sustainability of existing, mature communities. 

I devote my time and energy to work that serves as a precursor to propelling change  across communities in different areas of work and domains of expertise, and strongly believe that, until all communities are at par in terms of access to resources and empowerment by information that open source initiatives make available, there is more to learn and do. Often, the outcome of work I have collaborated with others on has been a spark in community conversations, contributions and adoptions on different subjects, increased opportunity for community leadership and participation, and pockets of knowledge transfer.

You can also find me on :bird:[Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/serahrono), :link: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/serahrono) and :woman_technologist: [read what I have been upto recently](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-authors/#blog-author-serah-njambi-rono).

Happy days!
